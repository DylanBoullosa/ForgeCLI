# ForgeCLI 🔨

ForgeCLI is a lightweight **C++ command-line tool** that generates clean project structures to help hackers and developers prototype faster.

Instead of repeatedly creating folders, boilerplate files, and README templates, ForgeCLI automates the setup so you can focus on building.

---

## Why ForgeCLI?

Starting a new project often means:
- Creating the same folders over and over
- Writing boilerplate `main.cpp` files
- Forgetting consistent structure
- Wasting time before real development begins

ForgeCLI solves this by acting as a **project forger** — you answer a few prompts, and your project is ready to hack on immediately.

## Features (in Progress)

- Interactive command-line prompts
- Automatic project folder generation
- Boilerplate C++ file creation
- README generation for new projects
- Clean, beginner-friendly project structures

---

## Tech Stack

- **C++17**
- Standard Library only:
  - `<iostream>`
  - `<filesystem>`
  - `<fstream>`
  - `<string>`

No external dependencies. No frameworks. No APIs.

---

## How It Works (Concept)

1. Run ForgeCLI from the terminal
2. Choose what type of project you want to create
3. Enter a project name
4. ForgeCLI generates folders and starter files
5. Open the generated project in your editor and start coding

ForgeCLI itself is a developer tool — generated projects are not part of this repository.
